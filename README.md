# datapump
For developers, database administrators and operations professionals who need interoperability and data exchange tools for Data Pump-type exports generated by Oracle(tm), datapump is a Java API for extracting information about compatible files, including metadata, table and row data without requiring external software. Unlike existing tools, this open-source project supplies a javax.sql.DataSource wrapper around an export file for running SQL queries against table data encoded within an export file using a low-footprint, in-memory H2 database.
